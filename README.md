# fashion-classification
Multi-class classification of the Fashion-MNIST dataset (provided by the Zalando research team)
 using Neural Networks.
## Developing environment
* Anaconda 5.0.1
* Python 3.6

## Getting started
To get the code running you need to install the following libraries using pip or conda
* Keras
* scikitimage
* scikitlearn
The dataset used is available here :

A pretrained cnn model  (best_cnn.h5) is available download it and run the Jupyter Notebook
(fashion_classification_demo.ipynb).

## Algorithm Description
Implementation of several neural networks models (MLP and CNN).

## Acknowledgments
 The code is based on some prior work including :
